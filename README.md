# GachiSoundBot
A Telegram bot which gets you things we all need in everyday life - gachi samples.

Code is trash-tier, honestly. I'm not a back-end developer, so, if you are, just pretend that I'm a retard who lives under a rock.

### Credits
 - [kt-telegram-bot by elbekD](https://github.com/elbekD/kt-telegram-bot) - maybe it's not as hipster as a Haskel wrapper for Telegram API, but it's still pretty cool.
 - [Gachimuchi Soundboard](http://soundboard.ass-we-can.com) - all samples are shamelessly streamed from there. If you think that it's wrong - contact me, we'll ~~wrestle~~ discuss it.
